<H1> COP3530 - Project 3 </h1>
This is how to run the code for the website.

<h2> Node.js/react </h2>

Need to have Node.js downloaded and be able to run npm start or npm install if need be.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-react-a-step-by-step-guide/

Go to this folder

project_3/frontend/react-website-bb

and then run this command

'npm start'

After that the website will be locally hosted on your browser (usually chrome).

Then test it out!
